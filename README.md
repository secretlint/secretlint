# Secretlint [![Actions Status](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/actions?query=workflow%3A"test")

Secretlint is pluggable linting tool to prevent commit secret/credential file.

## Purpose

- Scan files and if the file has secret and report it
- Prevent to commit credential files
- Pluggable architecture

## Motivation

- [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) is useful, but it is hard to setup per project.
	- It main use-case is globally installation
	- Secretlint want to install for a project and customize setting per project.
- [repo-security-scanner](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/repo-security-scanner), [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) and [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) is good scan tools
	- We need to flexible customize that include ignore by comment, ignore like gitignore
- [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) is similar tools, but it adopt opt-out approach
    - Secretlint adopt opt-in approach  
    - We also need to custom plugin by user

## Installation

### Using Docker

**Prerequisites:** Require [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

Use our [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint) to get an environment with Node.js and secretlint and running as fast as you can download them.

You can check all files under the current directory with secretlint by following command: 

    docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` -it secretlint/secretlint secretlint "**/*"

[`secretlint/secretlint` docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint) work without configuration by design.

Built-in rules:

- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend)

For more details, please see [secretlint's Dockerfile](./docker).

### Using Node.js

**Prerequisites:**  Require [Node.js 10+](https://nodejs.org/).

Secretlint is written by JavaScript.
You can install Secretlint using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install secretlint @secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend --save-dev
```

You should then set up a configuration file:

```
npx secretlint --init
```

After that, you can run Secretlint on any file or directory like this:

```
npx secretlint "**/*"
```

:memo: Secretlint support [glob pattern](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#basic-syntax) and glob pattern should be wrapped by double quote.

It is also possible to install Secretlint globally using `npm install --global`. But, We do not recommended it, some rules may be broken in globally.

## Usage

`secretlint --help` show Usage.

    Usage
      $ secretlint [file|glob*]
 
    Note
      supported glob syntax is based on microglob
      https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features
 
    Options
      --init setup config file. Create .secretlintrc.json file from your package.json
      --format formatter name. Default: stylish
      --output-file output file path that is written of reported result.
      --no-color disable color of output.
      --secretlintrc Path to .secretlintrc config file. Default: .secretlintrc.*
      --secretlintignore Path to .secretlintignore file. Default: .secretlintignore
      --profile Show performance profile
 
    Examples
      $ secretlint ./README.md
      # glob pattern should be wrapped with double quote
      $ secretlint "**/*"
      $ secretlint "source/**/*.ini"

## Configuration

Secretlint has a configuration file `.secretlintrc.{json,yml,js}`.

After running `secretlint --init`, you'll have a `.secretlintrc.json` file in your directory.

In it, you'll see some rules configured like this:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `id` property is the name of secretlint rule package. 

Secretlint does not have built-in rule.
You want to add some rule and You should **install** the package and **add** the rule to `.secretlintrc` file.

Each rule has same configuration pattern:

- `options`: Option definition for the rule. For more details, see each rule documentation
- `disabled`: If `disabled` is `true`, disable the rule
- `allowMessageIds`: `allowMessageIds` is an array of message id that you want to suppress error report
    - message id is defined in each rule and please see the rule documentation

### Example: `options`

For example, `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example` has `allows` in `options`.
This `allows` option define text pattern that you want to ignore.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example",
      "options": {
        "allows": [
          "/dummy_secret/i"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example: `allowMessageIds`

For example, you have got following error report by run `secretlint`:

```
$ secretlint "**/*"

SECRET.txt
  1:8  error  [EXAMPLE_MESSAGE] found secret: SECRET  @secretlint/secretlint-rule-example

✖ 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
```

This error's message id is `EXAMPLE_MESSAGE` in `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example`.

If you want to ignore this error, please use `allowMessageIds`.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example",
      "allowMessageIds": ["EXAMPLE_MESSAGE"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rule Packages

Secretlint rules has been implemented as separated modules.

- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-npm](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-npm)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-gcp](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-gcp)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-privatekey](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-privatekey)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-basicauth](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-basicauth)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-slack](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-slack)

Also, Secretlint provide rule preset that package some rule set.

- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend)
    - Recommended rule set

## Integration

### Pre-commit Hook

You can use Secretlint with some pre-commit tool.
This can prevent to commit secret data by linting with Secretlint.

#### [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

**Use Case:** If you want to introduce secretlint to Node.js project, this combination is useful.

Install [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged):

```
npm install husky lint-staged --save-dev
```

Edit `package.json`:

```json5
{
  // ...
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*": [
      "secretlint"
    ]
  }
}
```

This means that check each staged file by Secretlint before commit. 

#### [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

**Use Case:** You have a project that is developing with Docker. Easy to integrate to secretlint.

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

    # macOS. see also https://pre-commit.com/#install
    brew install pre-commit

Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```
-   repo: local
    hooks:
    -   id: secretlint
        name: secretlint
        language: docker_image
        entry: secretlint/secretlint:latest secretlint
```

Example setup repository:

- https://github.com/azu/secretlint-pre-commit-example

### GitHub Actions

If you already set secretlint [Using Node.js](#using-nodejs), you can run secretlint with your configuration on [GitHub Actions](https://github.co.jp/features/actions).

Put `.github/workflows/secretlint.yml` in your repository.

```yaml
name: Secretlint
on: [push, pull_request]
env:
  CI: true
jobs:
  test:
    name: "Secretlint"
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node_version: [12]
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: setup Node ${{ matrix.node_version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node_version: ${{ matrix.node_version }}
      - name: Install
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint with Secretlint
        run: npx secretlint "**/*"
```


## Architecture

### Opt-in instead of Opt-out

Secretlint adopt opt-in approach.

In our experience, linting tools that report various errors by default is difficult to use.
Opt-in approach help to introduce Secretlint increasing.

### Rule as Documentation

We think a rule as a documentation.
So, Each rule should have reasonable documentation.

We need to describe why this file is error. It lead to reduce false-positive error.

Also, Secretlint CLI support hyperlink in Terminal.
It means that you can jump to rule documentation from lint error message directly.

![clickable link in output](./docs/assets/docsUrl.png)

> Example on iTerm 2: Cmd + Click error's messageId and open [AWSSecretAccessKey](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/blob/master/packages/%40secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws/README.md#awssecretaccesskey) on your browser. 

If you want to know support terminal, please see [Hyperlinks in Terminal Emulators](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda). 

Also, Welcome to Contribution about secretlint documentation!

### Why Node.js?

- Package Manager
	- Require pacakge manager to realize flexible pluggable system
	- Node.js has npm and yarn as package manager
	- Package manger help to install custom plugin/rule by user
- Exist Reference Implementation
	- Node.js already has pluggable linting tools like ESLint, textlint, stylelint etc
	- So Node.js user familiar with pluggable linting tools
	- Previously, I created textlint as same approach, so I familiar with Node.js

Of course, secretlint also support [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint).
