> Secretlint is that Pluggable linting tool to prevent committing credential.

## Features

- Scanner: Found credentials in a project and report these
- Project Friendly: Easy to setup your project and integrate CI services
- Pre-Commit Hook: Prevent committing credential files
- Pluggable: Allow to create custom rule and flexible configuration
- Documentation: Describe the reason that rule detect it as secret

## Quick Start

You can try to use Secretlint on your project at one command.

If you already have installed Docker:

    docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --rm -it secretlint/secretlint secretlint "**/*"

If you already have installed Node.js:

    npx @secretlint/quick-start "**/*"

After running, 
If you got empty result and exit status is `0`, your project is secure.
Otherwise you got some error report, your project includes credential as plain format.

You want to get continuous security, Please see following installation guide and setup pre-commit hook and CI.

## Installation

### Using Docker

**Prerequisites:** Require [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

Use our [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint) to get an environment with Node.js and secretlint and running as fast as you can download them.

You can check all files under the current directory with secretlint by following command: 

    docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --rm -it secretlint/secretlint secretlint "**/*"

[`secretlint/secretlint` docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint) work without configuration by design.

Built-in rules:

- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend)

For more details, please see [secretlint's Dockerfile](./docker).

### Using Node.js

**Prerequisites:**  Require [Node.js 10+](https://nodejs.org/).

Secretlint is written by JavaScript.
You can install Secretlint using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install secretlint @secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend --save-dev
```

You should then set up a configuration file:

```
npx secretlint --init
```

Finally, you can run Secretlint on any file or directory like this:

```
npx secretlint "**/*"
```

:memo: Secretlint support [glob pattern](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#basic-syntax) and glob pattern should be wrapped by double quote.

It is also possible to install Secretlint globally using `npm install --global`. But, We do not recommended it, some rules may be broken in globally.

## Usage

`secretlint --help` show Usage.

      Secretlint CLI that scan secret/credential data.
    
      Usage
        $ secretlint [file|glob*]
    
      Note
        supported glob syntax is based on microglob
        https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features
    
      Options
        --init             setup config file. Create .secretlintrc.json file from your package.json
        --format           formatter name. Default: "stylish". Available Formatter: checkstyle, compact, jslint-xml, json, junit, pretty-error, stylish, table, tap, unix
        --output-file      output file path that is written of reported result.
        --no-color         disable ANSI-color of output.
        --no-terminalLink  disable terminalLink of output.
        --secretlintrc     path to .secretlintrc config file. Default: .secretlintrc.*
        --secretlintignore path to .secretlintignore file. Default: .secretlintignore
        --profile          show performance profile
    
      Examples
        $ secretlint ./README.md
        # glob pattern should be wrapped with double quote
        $ secretlint "**/*"
        $ secretlint "source/**/*.ini"

## Configuration

Secretlint has a configuration file `.secretlintrc.{json,yml,js}`.

After running `secretlint --init`, you'll have a `.secretlintrc.json` file in your directory.

In it, you'll see some rules configured like this:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `id` property is the name of secretlint rule package. 

Secretlint does not have built-in rule.
You want to add some rule and You should **install** the package and **add** the rule to `.secretlintrc` file.

Each rule has same configuration pattern:

- `options`: Option definition for the rule. For more details, see each rule documentation
- `disabled`: If `disabled` is `true`, disable the rule
- `allowMessageIds`: `allowMessageIds` is an array of message id that you want to suppress error report
    - message id is defined in each rule and please see the rule documentation

### Example: `options`

For example, `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example` has `allows` in `options`.
This `allows` option define text pattern that you want to ignore.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example",
      "options": {
        "allows": [
          "/dummy_secret/i"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example: `allowMessageIds`

For example, you have got following error report by run `secretlint`:

```
$ secretlint "**/*"

SECRET.txt
  1:8  error  [EXAMPLE_MESSAGE] found secret: SECRET  @secretlint/secretlint-rule-example

âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
```

This error's message id is `EXAMPLE_MESSAGE` in `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example`.

If you want to ignore this error, please use `allowMessageIds`.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example",
      "allowMessageIds": ["EXAMPLE_MESSAGE"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rule Packages

Secretlint rules has been implemented as separated modules.

- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-npm](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-npm)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-gcp](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-gcp)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-privatekey](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-privatekey)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-basicauth](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-basicauth)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-slack](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-slack)

Also, Secretlint provide rule preset that package some rule set.

- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend)
    - Recommended rule set

## Custom Rules

You can create own secretlint rule.

You want to get a secretlint rule for suitable your project and you can create it!
A secretlint rule is a just npm package.

If you want to know creating secretlint rule, please see [docs/secretlint-rule.md](docs/secretlint-rule.md).

## Integrations

### Pre-commit Hook per project

You can use Secretlint with some pre-commit tool.
This can prevent to commit secret data by linting with Secretlint.

Applying secretlint to the project and improve security on team developing.

#### [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

**Use Case:** If you want to introduce secretlint to Node.js project, this combination is useful.

Install [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged):

```
npm install husky lint-staged --save-dev
```

Edit `package.json`:

```json5
{
  // ...
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*": [
      "secretlint"
    ]
  }
}
```

This means that check each staged file by Secretlint before commit. 

#### [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

**Use Case:** You have a project that is developing with Docker. Easy to integrate to secretlint.

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

    # macOS. see also https://pre-commit.com/#install
    brew install pre-commit

Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```
-   repo: local
    hooks:
    -   id: secretlint
        name: secretlint
        language: docker_image
        entry: secretlint/secretlint:latest secretlint
```

Example setup repository:

- https://github.com/azu/secretlint-pre-commit-example

#### Bash Script

Alternately you can save this script as `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and give it execute permission(`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`):

```bash
#!/bin/sh
FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | sed 's| |\\ |g')
[ -z "$FILES" ] && exit 0

# Secretlint all selected files
echo "$FILES" | xargs ./node_modules/.bin/secretlint
# If you using docker
# echo "$FILES" | xargs docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --rm secretlint/secretlint secretlint
RET=$?
if [ $RET -eq 0 ] ;then
    exit 0
else
    exit 1
fi
```

### Pre-commit Hook globally

**Use Case:** If you want to check any project by secretlint, you can use global git hooks.

[Git 2.9+](https://github.blog/2016-06-13-git-2-9-has-been-released/) supports [`core.hooksPath`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).
It allow to integrate secretlint globally.

We have created example git hooks project using secretlint + Docker.

- [secretlint/git-hooks](https://github.com/secretlint/git-hooks)
    - Requirement: Docker

You can setup by following steps:

```shell script
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/secretlint/git-hooks git-hooks
cd git-hooks
# integrate secretlint to git hook globally
git config --global core.hooksPath $(pwd)/hooks
```

After setup of `core.hooksPath`, secretlint check any file before you commit it.  

For more details, see [secretlint/git-hooks](https://github.com/secretlint/git-hooks) project.

### GitHub Actions

If you already set secretlint [Using Node.js](#using-nodejs), you can run secretlint with your configuration on [GitHub Actions](https://github.co.jp/features/actions).

Put `.github/workflows/secretlint.yml` in your repository.

```yaml
name: Secretlint
on: [push, pull_request]
env:
  CI: true
jobs:
  test:
    name: "Secretlint"
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node_version: [12]
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: setup Node ${{ matrix.node_version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node_version: ${{ matrix.node_version }}
      - name: Install
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint with Secretlint
        run: npx secretlint "**/*"
```

This configuration also integrate Pull Request review comment via [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node).

## Motivation

- [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) is useful, but it is hard to setup per project.
	- It main use-case is globally installation
	- Secretlint want to install for a project and customize setting per project.
- [repo-security-scanner](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/repo-security-scanner), [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) and [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) is good scan tools
	- Secretlint need to flexible customize that include ignoring definitions, custom rules.
- [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) is similar tools, but it adopt opt-out approach
    - Secretlint adopt opt-in approach  
    - We also need to custom rules by user
		- See [Bring-your own-plugins (BYOP), via --custom-plugins option by KevinHock Â· Pull Request #255 Â· Yelp/detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets/pull/255)


## Philosophy

- Reduce false-positive of linting
- Integration to developing workflow
- Empower Users to Contribute

### Opt-in instead of Opt-out

Secretlint adopt opt-in approach.

In our experience, linting tools that report various errors by default is difficult to use.
Opt-in approach help to introduce Secretlint increasing.

It will help to reduce false-positive by configuration.

### Rule as Documentation

We think a rule as a documentation.
So, Each rule should have reasonable documentation.

We need to describe why this file is error.
A rule that has not documentation, It is just a opinionated.

Describe the reason of error and then it will lead to reduce false-positive error.

Also, Secretlint CLI support hyperlink in Terminal.
It means that you can jump to rule documentation from lint error message directly.

![clickable link in output](./docs/assets/docsUrl.png)

> Example on iTerm 2: Cmd + Click error's messageId and open [AWSSecretAccessKey](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/blob/master/packages/%40secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws/README.md#awssecretaccesskey) on your browser. 

If you want to know support terminal, please see [Hyperlinks in Terminal Emulators](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda). 

Also, Welcome to Contribution about secretlint documentation!

### Why Node.js?

- Package Manager
	- Require pacakge manager to realize flexible pluggable system
	- Node.js has npm and yarn as package manager
	- Package manger help to install custom plugin/rule by user
- Exist Reference Implementation
	- Node.js already has pluggable linting tools like ESLint, textlint, stylelint etc
	- So Node.js user familiar with pluggable linting tools
	- Previously, I created textlint as same approach, so I familiar with Node.js
- Users
    - JavaScript is Popular language
    - It means that empower Users to Contribute
    - Users can create own rule by own hand

Of course, secretlint also support [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint).

## Changelog
