> Secretlint is that Pluggable linting tool to prevent committing credential.

## Features

- **Scanner**: Found credentials in a project and report these
- **Project** Friendly: Easy to set up your project and integrate CI services
- **Pre-Commit Hook**: Prevent committing credential files
- **Pluggable**: Allow creating custom rule and flexible configuration
- **Documentation**: Describe the reason that rule detect it as secret

## Quick Demo

You can view secretlint linting result on <https://secretlint.github.io/>.

## Quick Start

You can try to use Secretlint on your project at one command.

If you already have installed Docker:

    docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --rm -it secretlint/secretlint secretlint "**/*"

If you already have installed Node.js:

    npx @secretlint/quick-start "**/*"

After running, 
If you got empty result and exit status is `0`, your project is secure.
Otherwise, you got some error report, your project includes credential as raw data.

![An example of secretlint results](./docs/assets/secretlint-report-example.png)

You want to get continuous security, Please see following installation guide and setup pre-commit hook and CI.

## Installation

### Using Docker

**Prerequisites:** Require [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

Use our [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint) to get an environment with Node.js and secretlint and running as fast as you can download them.

You can check all files under the current directory with secretlint by following command: 

    docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --rm -it secretlint/secretlint secretlint "**/*"

[`secretlint/secretlint` docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint) work without configuration by design.

This Docker Image has built-in packages:

- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend) 
- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-pattern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-pattern)
- [@secretlint/secretlint-formatter-sarif](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@secretlint/secretlint-formatter-sarif)

For more details, please see [secretlint's Dockerfile](./publish/docker).

### Using Node.js

**Prerequisites:**  Require [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/).

Secretlint is written by JavaScript.
You can install Secretlint using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install secretlint @secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend --save-dev
```

You should then set up a configuration file:

```
npx secretlint --init
```

Finally, you can run Secretlint on any file or directory like this:

```
npx secretlint "**/*"
```

:memo: Secretlint support [glob pattern](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#basic-syntax) and glob pattern should be wrapped by a double quote.

It is also possible to install Secretlint globally using `npm install --global`. But, We do not recommended it, some rules may be broken in globally.

        $ secretlint "**/*"
        $ secretlint "source/**/*.ini"
        # found secrets and mask the secrets
        $ secretlint .zsh_history --format=mask-result --output=.zsh_history

## Configuration

Secretlint has a configuration file `.secretlintrc.{json,yml,js}`.

- Document: [Configuring Secretlint](./docs/configuration.md)

After running `secretlint --init`, you'll have a `.secretlintrc.json` file in your directory.

In it, you'll see some rules configured like this:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `id` property is the name of secretlint rule package. 

Secretlint does not have built-in rule.
You want to add some rule and You should **install** the package and **add** the rule to `.secretlintrc` file.

Each rule has same configuration pattern:

- `options`: Option definition for the rule. For more details, see each rule documentation
- `disabled`: If `disabled` is `true`, disable the rule
- `allowMessageIds`: `allowMessageIds` is an array of message id that you want to suppress error report
    - message id is defined in each rule and please see the rule documentation

### Example: `options`

For example, `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example` has `allows` in `options`.
This `allows` option define a list of [RegExp-like String](https://github.com/textlint/regexp-string-matcher#regexp-like-string) that you want to ignore.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example",
      "options": {
        "allows": [
          "/dummy_secret/i"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

When you use a preset like `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend`, you need to put the option in `rules`.

For example, an option for `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend > @secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws` 

```json5
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend",
      "rules": [
        {
          "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws",
            "options": {
              "allows": [
	            // it will be ignored
                "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
              ]
            }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example: `allowMessageIds`

For example, you have got following error report by run `secretlint`:

```
$ secretlint "**/*"

SECRET.txt
  1:8  error  [EXAMPLE_MESSAGE] found secret: SECRET  @secretlint/secretlint-rule-example

âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
```

This error's message id is `EXAMPLE_MESSAGE` in `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example`.

If you want to ignore this error, please use `allowMessageIds`.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-example",
      "allowMessageIds": ["EXAMPLE_MESSAGE"]
    }
  ]
}
```

When you use a preset like `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend`, you need to put the option in `rules`.

For example, If you want to ignore "AWSAccountID" and "AWSAccessKeyID" of "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws", you can write following.

```json5
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend",
      "rules": [
        {
          "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws",
          "allowMessageIds": ["AWSAccountID", "AWSAccessKeyID"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Ignoring by comment

[@secretlint/secretlint-rule-filter-comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-filter-comments) supports ignoring comment like `secretlint-disable`.

```
// secretlint-disable

THIS IS SECRET, BUT IT WILL BE IGNORED

// secretlint-enable
```

For more details, please see [Configuring Secretlint](./docs/configuration.md).

## Use Cases

### Hide secrets in lint error message

Secretlint support `--maskSecrets` option that mask secrets in lint error message.
It is useful that you want to hide secrets in CI logs.

```bash
$ secretlint --maskSecrets "**/*"
```

### Fix secrets

Secretlint can not fix the secrets automatically.
However, It is useful that `--format=mask-result` mask the secrets of input file.

For example, you can mask the secrets of `.zsh_history` file and overwrite it.

```bash
$ secretlint .zsh_history --format=mask-result --output=.zsh_history
```

Also, Secretlint provide rule preset that includes recommened rule set.

- [@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend](./packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend)
    - Recommended rule set

## Custom Rules

You can create own secretlint rule.

You want to get a secretlint rule for suitable your project and you can create it!
A secretlint rule is a just npm package.

If you want to know creating secretlint rule, please see [docs/secretlint-rule.md](docs/secretlint-rule.md).

## Integrations

### Pre-commit Hook per project

You can use Secretlint with some pre-commit tool.
This can prevent to commit secret data by linting with Secretlint.

Applying secretlint to the project and improve security on team developing.

#### [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

**Use Case:** If you want to introduce secretlint to Node.js project, this combination is useful.

Install [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged):

```
npx husky-init && npm install lint-staged --save-dev
```

Add hooks to `.husky/pre-commit`:

```
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx --no-install lint-staged"
```

Edit `package.json`:

```json5
{
  // add "lint-staged" field
  "lint-staged": {
    "*": [
      "secretlint"
    ]
  }
}
```

This means that check each staged file by Secretlint before commit. 

#### [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

**Use Case:** You have a project that is developing with Docker. Easy to integrate to secretlint.

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

    # macOS. see also https://pre-commit.com/#install
    brew install pre-commit

Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```
-   repo: local
    hooks:
    -   id: secretlint
        name: secretlint
        language: docker_image
        entry: secretlint/secretlint:latest secretlint
```

Example setup repository:

- https://github.com/azu/secretlint-pre-commit-example

#### Bash Script

Alternately you can save this script as `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and give it execute permission(`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`):

```bash
#!/bin/sh
FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | sed 's| |\\ |g')
[ -z "$FILES" ] && exit 0

# Secretlint all selected files
echo "$FILES" | xargs ./node_modules/.bin/secretlint
# If you using docker
# echo "$FILES" | xargs docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --rm secretlint/secretlint secretlint
RET=$?
if [ $RET -eq 0 ] ;then
    exit 0
else
    exit 1
fi
```

### Pre-commit Hook globally

**Use Case:** If you want to check any project by secretlint, you can use global git hooks.

[Git 2.9+](https://github.blog/2016-06-13-git-2-9-has-been-released/) supports [`core.hooksPath`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).
It allow to integrate secretlint globally.

We have created example git hooks project using secretlint + Docker.

- [secretlint/git-hooks](https://github.com/secretlint/git-hooks)
    - Requirement: Docker

You can set up by following steps:

```shell script
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/secretlint/git-hooks git-hooks
cd git-hooks
# integrate secretlint to git hook globally
git config --global core.hooksPath $(pwd)/hooks
```

After setup of `core.hooksPath`, secretlint check any file before you commit it.  

For more details, see [secretlint/git-hooks](https://github.com/secretlint/git-hooks) project.

Node.js version also can be used for global git hook.
If you interesting in it, please see [@azu/git-hooks](https://github.com/azu/git-hooks).

### CI

#### GitHub Actions

If you already set secretlint [Using Node.js](#using-nodejs), you can run secretlint with your configuration on [GitHub Actions](https://github.co.jp/features/actions).

Put `.github/workflows/secretlint.yml` in your repository.

```yaml
name: Secretlint
on: [push, pull_request]
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  test:
    name: "Secretlint"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - name: Install
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint with Secretlint
        run: npx secretlint "**/*"
```

This configuration also integrate Pull Request review comment via [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node).

## Semantic Versioning Policy

Secretlint project follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/ "Semantic Versioning")([secretlint-rule-preset-canary](packages/@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-canary) is exception).

- Patch release (intended to not break your lint build)
    - A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).
    - Improvements to documentation.
    - Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring.
    - Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn't work for anyone).
- Minor release (might break your lint build)
    - A new option.
    - An existing rule is deprecated.
    - A new CLI capability is created.
    - New public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).
        - It might break TypeScript definitions
    - A new formatter is created.
- Major release (break your lint build)
    - A new option to an existing rule that results in secretlint reporting more errors by default.
    - An existing formatter is removed.
    - Add new default rule to rule preset.
    - Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way.

## Motivation

- [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) is useful, but it is hard to setup per project.
	- It main use-case is globally installation
	- Secretlint want to install for a project and customize setting per project.
- [repo-security-scanner](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/repo-security-scanner), [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) and [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) is good scan tools
	- Secretlint need to flexible customize that include ignoring definitions, custom rules.
- [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) is similar tools, but it adopts opt-out approach
    - Secretlint adopt opt-in approach  
    - We also need to custom rules by user
		- See [Bring-your own-plugins (BYOP), via --custom-plugins option by KevinHock Â· Pull Request #255 Â· Yelp/detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets/pull/255)
- GitHub support [secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-security/about-secret-scanning), but it only works after push to your repository
    - Secretlint work on your local machine, Secretlint can prevent to commit

## Philosophy

- Reduce false-positive of linting
- Integration to developing workflow
- Empower Users to Contribute

### Opt-in instead of Opt-out

Secretlint adopt opt-in approach.

In our experience, linting tools that report various errors by default is difficult to use.
Opt-in approach help to introduce Secretlint increasing.

It will help to reduce false-positive by configuration.

### Rule as Documentation

We think a rule as a documentation.
So, Each rule should have reasonable documentation.

We need to describe why this file is error.
A rule that has not documentation, It is just a opinionated.

Describe the reason of error and then it will lead to reduce false-positive error.

Also, Secretlint CLI support hyperlink in Terminal.
It means that you can jump to rule documentation from lint error message directly.

![clickable link in output](./docs/assets/docsUrl.png)

> Example on iTerm 2: Cmd + Click error's messageId and open [AWSSecretAccessKey](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint/blob/master/packages/%40secretlint/secretlint-rule-aws/README.md#awssecretaccesskey) on your browser. 

If you want to know support terminal, please see [Hyperlinks in Terminal Emulators](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda). 

Also, Welcome to Contribution about secretlint documentation!

### Why Node.js?

- Package Manager
	- Require package manager to realize flexible pluggable system
	- Node.js has npm and yarn as package manager
	- Package manager help to install custom plugin/rule by user
- Exist Reference Implementation
	- Node.js already has pluggable linting tools like ESLint, textlint, stylelint etc
	- So Node.js user familiar with pluggable linting tools
	- Previously, I created textlint as same approach, so I familiar with Node.js
- Users
    - JavaScript is Popular language
    - It means that empower Users to Contribute
    - Users can create own rule by own hand

Of course, secretlint also support [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretlint/secretlint).
